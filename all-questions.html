<h3>Rule 1 Questions</h3>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Easy Question:</strong> Which punctuation mark is used to separate two complete sentences?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Periods and semicolons can both separate independent clauses. Use a semicolon when the clauses are closely related, or a period when they're more distinct.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Easy Question:</strong> True or False: A semicolon can be used in the same way as a period to separate two independent clauses.<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Correct: Semicolons and periods can both separate independent clauses, but semicolons suggest a closer relationship between the clauses.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Easy Question:</strong> Which of these can come after a semicolon at the start of a clause?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Semicolons can precede conjunctive adverbs (e.g., however, therefore) at the start of a clause when connecting two independent clauses.</div>

<div class="question-item"><strong>Easy Question:</strong> Which sentence is punctuated correctly?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Both periods and semicolons can properly separate two complete sentences. Option A is a comma splice, which is incorrect. (A comma splice is always considered incorrect on the SAT/ACT.)</div>

<div class="question-item"><strong>Medium Question:</strong> Identify the incorrect sentence:<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Option 3 is considered a comma splice because it joins two independent clauses with just a comma. While sometimes used in informal writing, the SAT/ACT requires either a semicolon or a coordinating conjunction with the comma. (A comma splice is always considered incorrect on the SAT/ACT.)</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Medium Question:</strong> Which sentence demonstrates proper use of a semicolon?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Option 3 is correct because the semicolon properly separates two independent clauses and precedes the conjunctive adverb 'consequently' with a comma.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Medium Question:</strong> Select the properly punctuated sentence:<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Option 3 is correct because it uses a semicolon before 'therefore' (a conjunctive adverb) and a comma after it to connect two independent clauses properly.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Hard Question:</strong> Which of the following sentences demonstrates the correct use of a semicolon with a conjunctive adverb?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> A semicolon should precede the conjunctive adverb, and a comma should follow it when connecting two independent clauses.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Hard Question:</strong> Identify the sentence that contains a comma splice and explain why it is incorrect: 'The concert was sold out, we decided to listen to the album at home instead.'<br/><em>Explanation:</em> A comma splice occurs when two independent clauses are joined only by a comma. To correct it, one could use a period, a semicolon, or a comma followed by a coordinating conjunction. (A comma splice is always considered incorrect on the SAT/ACT.)</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Hard Question:</strong> Which of the following options correctly revises the sentence 'The research was extensive, it covered several years of data.' to use a semicolon?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> A semicolon correctly joins two independent clauses without the need for a coordinating conjunction or conjunctive adverb, unless a specific relationship (like contrast or cause-effect) is implied.</div>

<div class="question-item"><strong>Medium Question:</strong> Identify the sentence with incorrect punctuation:<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Option 3 is incorrect because it uses mixed punctuation (dash and comma). Non-essential information should be set off with matching punctuation on both sides.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Medium Question:</strong> Which option correctly uses a dash to introduce an explanation?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Option 1 is correct because the dash follows a complete independent clause and introduces an explanatory phrase.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Medium Question:</strong> Select the properly punctuated sentence:<br/><em>Explanation:</em> Option 1 is correct because the colon follows a complete independent clause and introduces an explanation.</div>
<div class="question-item"><strong>Hard Question:</strong> Which sentence correctly uses a colon to introduce a list after a complete independent clause?<br/><em>Explanation:</em> The colon must follow a complete independent clause.
